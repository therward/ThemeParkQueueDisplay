# ThemeParkQueueDisplay
Python script to show theme park queue times onto an external display

# Features coming soon

# Resources

To make my version of the Theme Park Queue Display, i used the following items. However the script can be amended to suppot most screens.The script can also be used with any raspberry pi, however i reccomend the zero w due to its small size. Having a raspberry pi with built in wifi (W models) is also useful to reduce the amount of wires and space it uses with no need for dongles. 

 + Screen - SSD1322/ER-OLEDM032 display 
 + Reaspberry Pi Zero W
 + Wires / power supply for the raspberry pi 




# Video Demo



# Upcoming Features

+ Stop displaying ride queue times when the park is shut and instead display "{park name} is now closed"
+ Give the option to display the weather on the display onces its cycled through the queue times (This will be optional)
+ Show the park opening hours to the left of the clock 

# Report a bug 

If there is an bug you have spotted, please create a GitHub issue and i will try to include a fix on the next version. Please note i am unable to
release a script to support all screen versions, make sure that your bug is not due to forgetting to ammend the code to support your screen.
